This is  a fun HTML challenge made by Dave Gray. He has an amazing HTML course available on Youtube and this was the challenge project that is part of the final lesson. He first provides some example material and a little bit of CSS to work with. From there I was able to create a website based of the example photos i was given. 

Coding languages involved are: HTML and CSS only.
